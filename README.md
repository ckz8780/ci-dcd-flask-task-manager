# Welcome!

This is a small task manager written in Flask and backended by a MongoDB database. It's part of the Data Centric Development module for CodeInstitute.

Make sure to set your env variables for DB connection via `export`

There is a live version of the application at https://ci-dcd-flask-task-manager.herokuapp.com (This is a free dyno and may go to sleep, so be patient on initial load!)
